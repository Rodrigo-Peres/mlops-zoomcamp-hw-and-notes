    "\n",
    "Right now there are two parameters for `main()` called `train_path` and `val_path`. We want to change the flow function to accept `date` instead. `date` should then be passed to a task that gives both the `train_path` and `val_path` to use.\n",

    "* a. The flow will take in a parameter called `date` which will be a datetime. `date` should default to `None`.\n",
    "* b. If `date` is `None`, use the current day. Use the data from 2 months back as the training data and the data from the previous month as validation data.\n",
    "* c. If a `date` value is supplied, get 2 months before the `date` as the training data, and the previous month as validation data.\n",
    "* d. As a concrete example, if the date passed is \"2021-03-15\", the training data should be \"fhv_tripdata_2021-01.parquet\" and the validation file will be \"fhv_trip_data_2021-02.parquet\".\n",

    "#### Q3. Saving the model and artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment, we are not saving the model and vectorizer for future use. You don't need a new task for this, you can just add it inside the `flow`. The requirements for filenames to save it as were mentioned in the Motivation section. They are pasted again here:\n",

    "* In this example we use a DictVectorizer. That is needed to run future data through our model. Save that as \"dv-{date}.b\". Similar to above, if the date is `2021-03-15`, the files output should be `model-2021-03-15.bin` and `dv-2021-03-15.b`.\n",
